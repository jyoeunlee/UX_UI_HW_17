         <p>A graphic designer based in Los Angeles, 
            specializing in User Interface Design. 
            Joeun enjoys creating memories and 
            keeping a record using photography 
            and videography. She is happiest 
            when she takes photos, works on videos, 
            and designs things. Without any of 
            her creating habits, her world would 
            be very boring.</p>
        <h3>her story:</h3>
         <p>Joeun designed just for fun. In her high school years, 
            she took art, ceramics, and video production just to enjoy various forms of art. 
            She never thought art related job could be something she can do for her entire life. 

            In college, she was a mathematics major. As usual, 
            she took an art class for her electives just to earn an easy A credit. 
            The art professor she met during the elective course told her, 
            “Don't let your talent go to waste.” And that words inspired her 
            to take art more serious and motivated to change the direction of her life. 
                
            Consequently, Joeun earned A.A degree and B.A degree in Art. 
            Her interests in various medium of arts (graphic design, painting, 
            ceramics, sculpture, photography, video production, figure drawing, etc) 
            lead her to decide which form of art she will do for her occupation 
            or for her entertainment.
                
            After graduation, Joeun started as a graphic designer at a lifestyle store. 
            She designs lots of different things including advertisement, 
            flyer, banner, signage, email graphic, apparel graphic, giftcard and 
            so much more. She is now a creative director who is in charge of 
            designs and she fulfills any visual needs for store website. 
            And in order to understand more about website design, she achieves 
            a certificate from UX/UI design bootcamp. </p>
